# Basic Parallel Python, an overview

All scripts are in folder `scr`. Slides in `docs`

## Python Standard Library

### Example 0: `threading`

`threading` is the Python Standard Library to run shared memory concurrent jobs without the need for a multi-core architecture. Is best suited for I/O, network and database non-CPU-intensive tasks.

`00_freesound_scraping.py` is a simple script to search and download sounds from the [fresound](https://freesound.org/) collaborative database. In `00_freesound_scraping_threading.py`, its a multithreaded implementation, we transform the `for` loops to functions definitions, and then initialize a `Thread` object for each queary and sound to download. Measure execution times:

    ./scr/$ time python 00_freesound_scraping.py
    ./scr/$ time python 00_freesound_scraping_threading.py

### Example 1: `multiprocessing`

`multiprocessing` is the Python Standard Library to spawn jobs across a number of CPU's. To know how many parallel processes you can have at any time in your computer do:

    $ python
    >>> from multiprocessing import cpu_count()
    >>> cpu_count()

This will print the number of *logical* cores of your computer, not *physical*. 

`10_mp32wav.py` is a script to convert all `mp3` files in a folder to `wav` format. `11_mp32wav_multiprocessing.py` is its parallel version. The `for` loop transformed to a function definition, then, we create a `Pool` of processes with the available number of cores (`cpu_count`), among which the tasks will be distributed evenly.

To test these scripts, first create a directory named `data` and then copy a bunch of `mp3` files in there, at least ~15 files. Then:

    ./scr/$ time python 10_mp32wav.py
    ./scr/$ time python 11_mp32wav_multiprocessing.py

### Example 2: `multiprocessing`, `pymp` and `mpi4py`

By running the `20_get_spectra.py` script, for each song in `data`, you will sequentially compute a FFT on a 20 s window and then write a `png` file with a simple figure of the resultant spectrum. Measure its execution time:
    
    ./scr/$ time python 20_get_spectra.py

We will paralelize using:

#### `multiprocessing`

We proceed as we did with example 1, creating a `Pool` of processes. In this case, if in OSx this program will most probably crash. There is a conflict with `matplotlib.pyplot` library and the way the processes are spawned or forked in the system, this is a known [bug](https://bugs.python.org/issue33725). 

#### `pymp`

[PyMP](https://github.com/classner/pymp) package brings OpenMP-like functionality to Python, hiding the use of `multiprocessing` library. Using `pymp` package the reference to this problem is printed out once, but the problem is solved internally by `pymp` and the execution continues without problem. Measure the execution time of this script:

    ./scr/$ time python 22_get_spectra_pymp.py

#### `MPI` and `mpi4py`

`MPI`, the Message Passing Interface, is a non-pythonian system, that you can [download](http://www.mpich.org/downloads/) and installed in your machine. `mpi4py` is the python library that let your program communicate with `MPI`. Both `MPI` and `MPI4Py` are already installed at [Kabr√© supercomputer](https://kabre.cenat.ac.cr/). Compare the execution time of `mpi4py` vs `pymp` (`mulitprocessing`)


    ./scr/$ time python 22_get_spectra_pymp.py
    ./scr/$ time python 23_get_spectra_MPI.py
